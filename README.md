# COVID-19-Analysis
How different aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic effected deaths, recovery and more.

In this project, I attempted to track and analyse the outbreak in the United States of America by focusing on total RTPCR tests conducted, number of hospitalizations that were led by the outbreak, number of people who recovered from COVID, the mortalities because of the outbreak, etc.
